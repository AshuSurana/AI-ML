The 3 yr old cat was fascinated for about 15 minutes but when the same pictures came on, she got bored.  The 5 year old watched for about a few minutes but then walked away. It is possible that because we have a wonderful courtyard full of greenery and trees and one of my neighbors has a bird feeder, that there is enough going on outside that they prefer real life versus a taped version.  I will more than likely pass this on to a friend who has cats that don't have as much wildlife to watch as mine do.",

I read all the reviews, and knew that vol. two was the best, hands down, but for few extra dollars I decided to get all three in a combo pack.  Since birds are a natural source of food for cats (feral) it was natural that they were instantly attracted to vol. two. Contrary to all the cartoons, cats are not fishermen, and thus, fish, either in a bowl or in the wild are not something they are naturally attracted to. Since gerbils and guinea pigs are not native where I live, they could have been little dogs as far as my cats could tell. Rodents are also a natural food, so volume one was much better than volume three. Also, the quality could have been better (for my eyes only) but my cats could care less about video quality... they just see birds..  LOL",

        "reviewText": "Tried a couple other products before this, but this the only one that has worked.  I have two dogs and the second one started this habit and taught it to our first dog.  So disgusting!  As suggested by others we doubled the dosage and so far (about six months plus) it's been working I would say about 90% of the time (that we can tell).My husband and I work long hours so they are in our side yard (about 15 x 45) for many hours by themselves with a door to the garage.  Though we walk them in the morning and then check the side yard for any deposits before we leave for work, before using this product, it was not uncommon for us to come home to dogs with horrible breath and a side yard of half-eaten piles.  We also had a dog walker come 2-3 times a week in the middle of the day to walk them again (and pick up any piles) to alleviate this problem.  However, we still ecountered this problem rather frequently.  The poor dogs really suffered for it too because we didn't want them anywhere near us at night because they smelled so disgusting.With this product, we believe that the habit has stopped, if not all the way, at least to a significant degree.  Other than I think twice in the last six months, we now come home to dogs that don't gross us out with their bad breath anymore.  And everyone is much happier for it.One more thing:  Our first dog was starting to get finicky with his food.  I don't know if this powder was to blame or if it's a supplement that we also give to him.  But what I found out works really well are those liver biscotti sprinkles.  Just adding a bit of those to the top of his dry dog food really helps with his finishing his food.  (The second dog is a food inhaler so she's got no problem with anything we give her or add to her food.)",

We just have one other dog, her brother. She immediately began ingesting feces from both her and her brother. I'm not sure if this is a habit from living with many other dogs or was brought on by the stress of being in a new home, but I was determined to stop it.We tried a product from Drs. Foster and Smith called Distaste and it worked quite well, but my male dog wasn't terribly thrilled with it-- it came in chew form and he didn't seem to like them. So I found this SEP and was glad to see it's something mixed into their food. It does not work as well as the Distaste, but seems to discourage her. All winter I have noticed my female picking up frozen specimens and marching around the yard with them... but she doesn't seem to be eating them. I plan to double the dose, as some other reviewers have noted, and we'll see how things go through the spring. We are typically quick about cleaning up after them, particularly now that we can see the ground, but occasionally we miss a pile. I'm hoping that the problems we had this winter with the SEP not working well were maybe because the feces were frozen, and now that things are thawing, maybe the SEP will discourage her more strongly.So bottom line, it seems to be working fairly well, but has not broken the habit completely. My only other comment is the smell of the product itself. It smells like Pixie Stick dust, or something similarly sweet/sour and I find the smell really awful. My husband and two sons don't seem to mind, but I hold my breath until I get it mixed into the dogs' food.",

        "reviewText": "Very simple, cheap, and easy, it would seem this feeder would be perfect.  I bought it at Lowe's for about the same price on Amazon a few weeks ago.  A couple problems: the hook at the top slides around the short section of wire on the cage that it hooks on (maybe an inch total).  Just means that it doesn't sit perfectly level.  The problem with that is that the birds don't like sitting on the downward-sloping part, so they only use the upward sloping part.  I'm going to try modding it so the hook isn't detachable and doesn't slide, but just stays in the middle so it's level.  The other issue is that the birds don't like sitting on the front/back of the suet cage, I think because it moves around a lot when they land, but every time they try it, there's a lot of wing flapping for a few seconds before they give up and use the other feeder.  This might get better with time.  If it does, I will update this review.  For now, I would say it's so-so for a suet feeder.  I've been looking at nicer more expensive ones, but I'll give this another month (and update this review!)UPDATE: The feeder made it through the season, but I don't think I'd buy again.  Not even sure if I'll put it out next year.  I have another feeder that has space for suet on each side.  That suet gets eaten REALLY quickly, while the one in the cage lasts long enough to start molding (several weeks).  They do eat the one in the cage, and maybe would use it more if I didn't have better alternatives right there.  For the price it's ok I guess, but I don't think I'd buy again.",

Yes, some of the food can tumble out when the bin is full and you have the bin positioned as shown. If you turn it so that the door is on top, the problem is solved.  My dogs cannot get into these containers, nor do vermin. I have found them very durable, and you can clean them as you like every so often with bleach or alcohol or whatever product you prefer.  One of the main reasons that I like these is that they are actually pleasant to look at. You can also open the door with one hand.  I have small dogs, so food lasts fairly long.  If I had larger dogs, I would probably opt for a larger container.  I have just ordered another from Amazon.  Until I read the reviews, I had not considered using them for anything but dogfood - but I might consider how they could help me with other storage needs.My package just arrived, and much to my disgust it contained a Bergen storage bin (doesn't match) in a color that it ugly to me.

        "reviewText": "The Good Stuff: My cats love this litter box. When I'm cleaning it they pace around me like a child waiting for their teddy bear to come out of the wash. When I had one cat the bin needed to be emptied once a week. Now with 2 it's more like every 3 days. I line the bin with a little trash bag and it works great. No need to buy the expensive receptacles. Every so often I'll have to use the special litter scoop that comes with it to scrape some \"left over\" off the rake. It does make a noise but it's not that loud. I recommend leaving it in a closet or laundry room. Guests always ask why my boiler room is making noise. The noise doesn't bother my cats, they actually come running to watch it work. It is, however, the only litter box they've ever known.The Catch: I bought the box in April and had no problems until late October when I realized the box was getting very full. The censors had stopped working. I called their customer service, who's pre-recorded message makes you think you've called the wrong number (they start talking about tools), and spoke with some friendly but not 100% knowledgeable people. They gave me all kinds of instructions on how to fix it myself like dusting off the censors, \"re-setting\" the box by clicking the switches 10 times each, etc. All of these things I tried as they are in the instructions but I humored them. Finally they gave me instructions on how to get a new box so now I'm in the process of mailing the wire that powers the rake, the battery compartment cover, my receipt, and $10 so I can get a new one. I'm not too happy that I had to destroy my box with no guarantee they will send me a new one but I understand why they make you do it.The Moral of the Story: Nothing makes a cat happier than a clean littler box and now that it's broken I simply can't keep it clean enough for them (in their opinions). I'm going to get the replacement and use it until it breaks too but I think I'm going to look into the toilet training kit.",

I have only one small cat.  You can't beat not having to think about the catbox, it's almost like not having one at all--compared to the old fashion litter box.I first saw the Litter Maid in the LA Times Magazine around 1995, there was a full page ad, and you could pay in three installments, it was expensive, at least a couple hundred.  Catbox scooping depressed me so i ordered one.  Mine worked right out of the box.it's always tricky putting the right amount of litter in.  If i put too much, it just keeps recycling and raking until i take some out.  Following the instructions, i found that there would be too much litter and the machine would malfunction, but if i put it lower than the limit line, it would be fine.I had some kind of technical problem in the beginning, i can't remember what, and was pleased with their tech support, they took care of me, way back then.After a few years, it stopped working and i gladly got another one.  At some point, i began using Litter Pearls cat litter in it when that first came out.  That was yet another technical advance for my situation.  The Litter Pearls absorbed the urine so there was less stuff getting scooped into the box, and i was able to go even longer without being reminded of the litter box.In the beginning, Litter Pearls was just regular little round pearls. Then, my pet store came out with \"lite tracking litter pearls\" which were not round. They made them irregular shaped and rough, to prevent tracking i guess. That new light tracking style did not agree with my Litter Maid.  It was too granular and it jammed up the mechanism.  My pet store stopped carrying the regular non-lite tracking kind of Litter Pearls, so i had to search for an alternative.The combination of those little round litter balls and the Litter Maid did great things for my quality of life.  I did not want to go backwards into using the old fashioned kind of litter. I was ready to buy the regular Litter Pearls from the company in another state, (i called around) if necessary, or on eBay, but i was able to find another brand that had the round balls in a local store, the brand is Litter Secret, i couldn't find the product on the web though.As long as i had the little round ball litter, not the lite tracking kind, my Litter Maid performed consistently.  The second one lasted several more years with never a mechanical problem.  Long ago, i got the tent. I would always use a tent with the Litter Maid.  For me, the less evidence of a litter box the better.The Litter Maid rake did not clean easily and with my policy of not paying a lot of attention to the litter box, eventually the second Litter Maid got messy and the price had come way down on them, so i decided rather than clean it, i'd just get a new one.  the motor was still working fine, there was no problem with it after several years. I just didn't feel like cleaning it, was working lots of overtime and my job and felt i could afford a new one. I've had the third one for several more years, it has been very low maintenance, no mechanical problems, i just have cleaned it every few weeks, i'm not sure how often, maybe 2 weeks, maybe more, it seems long between times when i have to deal with it.Recently it stopped working.  The light was on but without warning, it wouldn't become active, it just sat there.I got a Litter Robot to replace it, because of the great reviews and decided i would try a change, since LItter Robot will let you return it for 60 days.  I'm still evaluating the Litter Robot, but there are some things that so far, i like better about the Litter Maid, one is, i didnt' have to regularly clean the Litter Maid, just take out the plastic containers, and then do a big cleaning once in a great while.  I think i'm going to have to clean the Litter Robot more often.The Litter Maid plastic containers were easier for me to switch out and replace than the plastic bags for the Litter Robot, less struggle, less time spent bending over the \"dreaded area.\"  And more secure feeling because stiff plastic is thicker than a plastic bag.Being inside the tent, the LItter Maid didn't have anything directly exposed to open air, whereas the Robot sits there with its door open and litter sitting out there in contact with the rest of the world.  Having said all of that, the LItter Robot is very cool.  More ingenious than the LItter Maid.  anyone could dream up the LItter Maid.  It would take a special kind of mind to think up the Litter Robot.  Watching it do its thing is something to behold, in terms of human engineering.  I was very happy with the LItter Maid, my three worked reliably and flawlessly each one for many years.  I didn't have to deal with tech support.  But again, i had only one small cat.Oh, i almost forgot. My cat always liked to use only one side of the Litter Maid, so the waste would pile up on one end of the plastic container, causing it to fill up faster, only on that side, than it would if it had been distributed evenly.  When it fills up and doesn't close completely, that's when i can smell it and i go into action to change the container, but i alway would find that half the container wasn't used, it was empty on one side, full on the other. This never affected the mechanical performance of the Litter Maid itself.Update:  10/3/10I have just retired my most recent Litter Maid which i started using a year ago.  I was having a very hard time with it.  It worked well as far as the motor and everything it's supposed to do, but the problem  was with the litter (crystals). The crystals were getting saturated in only about 4 days and if i didn't change the litter, my cat would pee on the floor cover that i kept under the litter maid.  That is way too frequent to have to deal with cat sewage, by my standards.  Urine was getting all over the box and under the box. I thought the litter maid was leaking but couldn't find any openings.  It took me a long time to figure out that my cat's hyperthyroid condition was causing her to excessively urinate.  When i realized it, about two months ago, i doubled her medication and the problem has gone away. but she continued to refuse to use the Litter Maid, i think it must've developed an odor because of all the urine all over it, i tried to wipe it off but far from perfectly i'm sure.  Even though the crystals weren't saturated at all, she was peeing on the floor cover.  So i have just replaced the Litter Maid with a ScoopFree automatic box. So far it's working great. I took the Litter Maid outside, cleaned it as best i could with diluted Simple Green spray, it looks ok, i put it some big plastic bags and will keep it in the garage.  It has been working very well.  A real trooper.I want to say that i appreciate the Litter Maid, it served me well for about 16 or more years, about 5 of them over those years, two were thrown out not because they wore out but because they were dirty so in my experience they have worked well. I never had a problem with the motors, and i was always impressed at the way it just kept raking over and over, never giving out.This is different from some peoples' experience.  I want say that i have always used Litter Pearls crystals in the litter Maid, not clay or clumping litter, and that may be why i haven't had the same problems some have had.  I would recommend using crystal litter with it, but in my experience, it had to be the rounded kind, not the trackless/lite tracking kind which are irregularly shaped.  The trackless kind were too abrasive and jagged for the litter maid, they jammed it up, causing the rake to come to a painful creaking halt in mid cycle. But the rounded ones work well, they just aren't easy to find because people tend to prefer lite tracking litter.  But other than that, the crystals have always worked great in the Litter Maid.",

I have no regrets getting this model again.  Sometimes I have to scrape the kitty goo from the bottom of the box where it seeps and coagulates, but I had to do that with the old box too. When you change and clean the litter box section, wipe some baby oil on the bottom of the pan before you add new litter, it helps to lift the coagulated kitty goo more easily.",

This LitterMaid LM500 Automated Litter Box was the first automated solution we tried. I'm afraid it wasn't our last, as it had numerous problems.First, the tines would get clumped full of stuff and it would get caked solid rather quickly. I'll note that we didn't even try having this be the \"only\" litter box in our home! We had two others there too. We just wanted to see how well this worked. The storage container would get jammed in the open position, so that it did not do a good job of managing stench.However, we could have dealt with those issues. We could have cleaned the tines daily, and pushed down the lid ourselves regularly. The real problem was far more serious.First, understand how this works. The system sense motion and then X minutes after the cat has left the area, the tines move across, dragging any solids and clumps with it, pushing those items into the receptacle plastic box at the far end. Then the tines return to their original position and wait for a new visit.What happened with our unit would be that the tines would decide that they were ALWAYS ON and would keep going back and forth, back and forth, driving the poor kitties to distraction. There was no way they were going to jump in there and try to do their business while a set of metal tines was growling towards them!We tried several times to fix this, but it really just wasn't worth it. We moved on to other options and found a GREAT one. This one went in the trash as we couldn't even imagine subjecting any other cat owner to it. A large waste of money.Not well recommended.I'll give it 2/5 stars on the assumption that some units do NOT do that random motion thing - but it would only take one fritz in a lifetime to really demolish a cat's desire to ever use the unit again :)",

The thing still gets messed up and cleaning all the little corners and angles is a dirty job and it cannot be done with a hose because all the electronics are not protected in any way from water.  It is not a substitute when one goes away for more than 2 days.  I have two cats using this and not full time.  I needs to be emptied every two days. You must use good quality clumping litter.  The replacement canisters are expensive if you do not reuse them.  In fact, it is cheaper to just use a coventional litter pan and throw away the whole thing litter and all instead of using the refuse containers as throw away items.  The lids will fall off and need to be taped in place.My unit burned out when one of the cats pulled out the power cord at the end of the unit.  It just kept getting fuller and fuller and I was gone for a few days.  Even though it is supposed to be protected from running when blocked, when I returned I found the unit almost extended to the refuse bin and the stupid wire which hangs out in the middle of the box had been tangled by one of the poor cats trying to use the unit when it broke.  BAD DESIGN!I am ordering one of the rocking style units and returning my second unit.By the way, the best litter boxes have strong curves at all corners so they are easy to clean.

The rake also is super sensitive to overload and will go back and forth 3 or 4 times before giving up and flashing -- essentially jammed and unusable until you physically scoop the problem away, clean the rake and reset it. The sound of the rake going back and forth at all hours of the night is NOT a nice one and no matter what they say, this thing is STILL LOUD!You have to be really carefully about how much litter you put in the box and if your cat is like my boy and has a good size bladder you're in trouble.I purchased the tent to go with this, but didn't keep it on because it gets nasty too ... and I read that cats don't like to go to the bathroom in an enclosed space any more than we like porta potties!The cost of the plastic containers is prohibitative but at least they can be used over again.

        "reviewText": "I'd like to note that the review I wrote below, I will not change, but I have this to add:  The thing needs semi regular cleaning. I mean cleaning completely, with a new coat of scotch-guard on the pan surface and fresh litter refilled.And that may not make a difference if you have a cat that aims for the plastic tines. And cleaning those is kinda nasty. I've noticed that a new version is out with metal tines.  Maybe the manufacturer's cat had good aim too.Since writing the review below we got a cat with exceptional aim. He could jam up that thing in one session. We were cleaning it every day, and finally opted this year to get a plain old deep rectangular litter pan with scoopable litter and ditch the Litter Maid.  Heck - we were in cleaning it everyday anyway due to our 'artistic' new cat.---------------------------------------I have three cats, all indoor, and you can imagine I've tried about every kind of litter to come up with something workable for both me and the cats.I've had a LitterMate (the larger size) for almost a year now and think this is the next best thing to sliced bread. we liked it so well, we've recently gotten the regular sized one as well since the cats were giving the one we had such a workout.Pros:Our dogs no longer go litter-diving for 'snacks'. The mechanism scares them and most of the contents are now hidden away in the plastic container.The cats are only fascinated by the workings of the litterbox and had no problem adjusting. The oldest was 6, the youngest 5 months.Scoopable litter + three cats previously meant 2-3 times a day  scooping the litterbox. One LitterMate + three cats = 2-3 times a week tray dumping.  The trays are easily reused, making them more economical.The box itself has been dumped and cleaned every other month. The comb is held in place by two screws and is easily removed from the engine to be cleaned. I soak the bottom pan and comb in an antibacterial  cleaner solution, and after it's dry use Scotchguard on both.The house I live in is small - there are few places to hide litterbox odor. This does it effectively.One of our cats like to dig his way to China when he covers his stuff.  I was worried that the scratches on the bottom of the pan would cause more sticking than normal, but a generous coating of Scotchguard keeps things moving along in spite of the battle scars in the LitterMaid.Cons:Yes - litter does escape underneath a little, but with the activities of three cats we were always vaccuming around the litter box anyway - no difference there.The litter flinging problem happened once to me - every time afterwards I threw the garbage bag on top of the tray while I removed it, then just tipped it into the bag. Again, no biggie.Tips:Those lines in the litterbox aren't kidding - don't fill the box over the red line, or the motor will jam.When they say Premium clumping litter, they mean it.  The alternative is a constantly jammed motor.Whenever you empty the tray, pass the scraper through the pan to make sure that nothing escaped the comb along the bottom. Those spots can build up and cause a jam too.If stuff sticks too often to the comb or bottom, it usually means it's time to dumb the entire box and clean and re-coat it with nonsitck spray. Not the non-stick spray used in cooking either.",

        "reviewText": "This thing has a number of problems with it. None really prevents it from performing its function (eventually) but all add up to a real pain. One problem is that the plastic boxes that the cat manure is scooped up into do not fit very well into their canister. As a result cat litter seeps through the gaps and you end up having to vacuum underneath every few days. It should not have been that difficult to make a better fitting plastic box or area where it is to be placed.A second problem is that the red \"fill\" line is misleading. If litter is filled up to that point (or even fairly close to it) the machine jams. As a result, to prevent jamming, one needs to fill the device with far below its full capacity. This, in turn, necessitates filling the machine with more cat litter than should be the case (i.e., twice a week instead of once).A third problem is that the rakes, many times, get jammed due to filling up with litter. The rakes should have been made further apart to reduce this.In short, the machine does do its job but with a few relatively minor modifications (that should have been easy to spot for the manufacturer) this machine could have been much improved._______________________________Update:After less than one year machine breaks down and needs to be replaced. Tech support provided by company of very limited use in even determining how (possibly) to fix the problem (assuming it can be to begin with). Hence a one star product.",

Yes, as some reviewers have mentioned, sometimes it does stick to the bottom and you will have to use the scooper to scrape it up or clean the rakes sometimes. Then, I just turn it on and off and it will rake everything up.  It only takes me a few seconds to check for any stuck spots or even out the litter, turn it on and off to make it rake and then add a little new litter to the top (so the cats think it's nice and clean). :-) It's not completely \"no work\" but it is a lot less work than a \"manual\" litterbox and stays smelling cleaner than manual boxes.  I do use larger plastic grocery bags in the receptacle. It's a lot cheaper than throwing away receptacles every 3-4 days and it's alot easier to clean. Believe me, I do not like trying to pry those receptacles out when it is completely full.  You have to stick your fingers inside to grab onto it (YUCK!) and it's heavy and hard to get out sometimes dumping litter and stuff all over the place (double YUCK).The Seller on Ebay was selling the one I bought with a \"super charged\" motor (which is in the electrical cord). It worked pretty good for almost a year. Apparently, unlike the \"normal motor\", the stronger motor kept it from resetting sometimes when it would hit clumps that were too big for it.  It would attempt to plow right thru which sounds like a good thing, but it wasn't. Apparently the gears and/or sprokets which move the rake along are made of plastic and within a year they were stripped. It started out making a spinning sound once in awhile but would eventually go ahead and rake. One day I came home to a god awful sound. I found the rake stuck right in the middle of the box, gears just spinning and making a heck of a racket. This was enough to scare away ALL 4 cats from the ONLY litterbox. Needless to say we had some accidents. 3 of my cats \"recovered\" and would go back to the disconnected box, but my 20 year old cat was traumatized and refused to use it. So I had to set up the manual box. I'm STILL working with her trying to get her to stop going elsewhere because of this.I took the Littermaid to a repair shop and they knew immediately that the gears were stripped because they'd seen it before. They said they couldn't repair it because they couldn't get parts.I contacted the Ebay Seller who said it was still under warranty. I had to pay shipping to and from the Seller though which was not cheap. The 2nd supercharged Littermaid started doing the same thing after less than 6 months and the Seller says this one is not under warranty. Apparently, the warranty does not extend to the replacement that they sent me which I think is a rip-off considering how expensive these things are.While the 1st Littermaid was being repaired, I went ahead and bought another \"regular\" (not supercharged) Littermaid from Petsmart. I've had it 8 months and had no skipping problems so far. I think the \"supercharged\" motor caused all my problems, but KittenKaboodle refuses to acknowledge this and refused to warranty the 2nd box that they sent me.So, overall it's great when it works, but it could use a few improvements. The bottom of the pan needs to be made of something more \"non-stick\" so the rake can get thru some of the larger wet spots and/or the gears need to be made of something stronger to be able to take a stronger motor that can get thru the stuck on clumps (and not strip the gears). Also I would like to see a slightly larger receptacle on the larger models. They are made for a multi cat household but with only one litterbox it fills up pretty fast. With 2 litterboxes it's not too bad though. I would also like to see some sort of hood like other auto litterboxes that I've seen. That tent seems like a nuisance (it looks like it would block the on/off switch and collect litter in the box.)",

I buy cheap litter because I've heard that clumping litter can be bad for kitties because they lick their paws and it can cause intestinal blockage. I keep the box, garbage bags, the litter and the deodorizer in the closet - every 3rd day or so I just dump the whole box and add new litter and the deodorizer. I do smell it right after the kitties go - but not shortly thereafter. Try this, if you are leary of buying the litter maid.  I rated it a 3 since I have no experience and it seems a lot of people hate this thing!",

I liked the idea that I no longer would have to worry about having to scoop out cat waste or have a strong cat waste smell in my home.  I bought the LM920 which I found to have a quiet and decent motor. Unfortunately, it only lasted about three years.  Then I bought the LM900 as the LM920 was no longer made even though it is superior to the LM900 and quieter.  The first LM900 I bought lasted about a year and half, and I found the motor noisy and not very sturdy.  The second LM900 lasted about a year.  I bought the third LM900 and it only lasted two days before the rake stopped in the dumping into the receptacle mode and wouldn't move anymore.  I had to unscrew the rake so I could empty the receptacle which was full of lovely cat waste, dump the current amount of cat litter and return it to Amazon so I could get a replacement.  The replacement one broke also with the rake in the upright position so again, I had to unscrew the rake to get to the almost full receptacle to dump it out. Don't bother buying the Littermaid LM900 model as it is obviously doesn't last.  I went and bought the latest version of the Littermaid which is a LME9000 and it is better with a timer so the rake doesn't run during during a 9 hour duration but I still run into the rake getting stuck at various times and it also pushes unused litter into the receptacle.  I go through way more litter now which is frustrating but it does seem to have a stronger motor.",

I use the multi-cat formula litter in ours, even though we only have the single cat.  It just keeps things smelling nicer longer and you don't really have to worry about the mess.  My only complaint with this thing is that sometimes it scoops litter onto the floor but hey, that's what brooms are for!  We have ours in the basement so that really isn't much of a factor regarding the litter spillage.  However, I do still keep out a regular box just because ours likes to do one in one box, and the other in another box.  I'm tempted to get two of these Littermaids just so I don't have to worry about changing the other box!Ours gets clumps on the rake as well when our boy likes to urinate on it, but I just use a regular cat scooper and scrape it off.  Also, those refills are tremendously expensive so I do as the previous reviewer and just reuse them, fill them with a deodorizer (baking soda works great and it's cheap!), and voila!  I've not had any trouble with mine getting so full that I couldn't get it out to empty.  It snaps out pretty easily, even if there's quite a load there in it.This is one of the best products I've bought for a very long time and I'm very happy and glad that it's around.

Then it would reverse and push the unscooped waste into the mechanisim and it was just gross! I was useing premium clumping litter so it wasn't the litter. I spent more time cleaning this litter box than I did the old fashion kind. I finally threw this thing away after about 6-12 months of trying to deal with it. I went out and bought an old fashioned covered box, it is cleaner, smells better and doesn't constantly jam the way my Littermaid did.Maybe if you have one cat of small to average size or even two small cats this thing will work fine but if you have a large cat or multiple large cats this thing is a disaster!",

As other reviewers have noted, it works OK, but not perfect.  Help is needed at times, but it's still a big benefit to have.  The rakes need to be cleaned periodically, since the clumps are not fully dried after 10 minutes.  And the litter needs to be redistributed away from the collection box several times each week as a result of the rakes getting filled with wet clumps.  Our cats used it almost immediately after it was set up, and still seem to enjoy watching it operate.We have had one unit for about 18 months, and added a second recently.  Both work equally well.  We use plastic grocery bags in the collection box, which is easier than using the plastic boxes.  You may wish to add a timer to turn it off over-night, so it doesn't wake you.",

It seems that after 4-5 years the motors finally give out.  - However, that is 4-5 years of it sweeping the litter clean multiple times every day.I have three cats and I always have 2 of these boxes in use.  Primarily I bought them after I adopted a rescue kitten - who as it turned out, has the coronavirus that can cause Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP). Some apparently healthy cats may carry the virus which can be shed intermittently in bodily fluids or feces, with feces being the most common source of oral infection.She is completely healthy by all other standards - but if she or the other two catch a cold, or feel stressed etc., this coronavirus can surface. Much like a herpes virus in humans. And like the herpes virus it is easily transmitted. With cats the primary method that they transmit illness to each other is through feces.With the LitterMaid automatic box - the potential for all the cats to  step on or otherwise put a nose to each other's waste is almost completely eliminated. (with 2 boxes - I have never seen one cat go into a box right after a cat has used it. - They go to the other one, which is clean and ready for their use)And because I can work some very long hours. 16-18 hrs some days. I feel a bit more assured knowing the box is keeping itself clean.It does take a bit to get used to as far as the noise of the rake and what it takes to do a through clean.  But, as I like them so much for what they do that I don't mind the maintenance. Which isn't as involved as it would seem. It's actually rather simple to clean with a wet handrag and the occasional vacuum or dustbuster (which can be said of almost all litter boxes)Another advantage -- you don't need much litter and it goes much further.You do need to use a premium letter (I use 'the World's Best Litter') - but because it lasts as long as it does, it is a financial bargain.",

Try both to see which suits you best. Then simply put the bag in the receptacle, fold the sides and ends down and put the receptacle in the machine. When the receptacle is full just take out the receptacle, remove the bag with its contents, tie the top in a knot to contain the odor, and put it in the trash. The receptacle remains perfectly clean and can be used until it falls apart. This method has probably saved me many hundreds of dollars over the years and takes all the mess and cleaning out of the process.",

If you do, the rake can't complete its scan and goes back and forth, back and forth... You'd better hope that Fluffy doesn't have an urgent delivery to make at that point.Second, the machine is designed to require the use of proprietary, expensive, very fragile waste receptacles. You may work around this requirement by using plain grocery bags to line the receptacles, but after a few weeks of use the receptacles break anyway.Third, the capacity is lacking; When I got my second cat I found out I had to empty out the machine practically every day. If I waited for the second day, the container would overfill, sometimes because all the clumps were on the same side, keeping the lid open (you can imagine the smell)Finally, my youngest cat has a very fragile stomach. Well let me tell you, the raking process is not designed to handle runny poo. This was the last drop in the bucket, which prompted me to do some research on the web. Six months ago, I bought the litter-robot (litter-robot dot com), and my two cats and I couldn't be more satisfied.In summary, the LitterMaid is great if you only have one cat who never gets the runs. Otherwise, the Litter-Robot is a much better choice (but it costs twice as much)",

The litter is kept clean and smoothed by the automatic raking action.  Odors are minimal since waste is stored in a closed container and the exposed litter is continually cleaned.  Make sure you only use premium, clumping litter.  That's the good news.Now for the not so good news.  The unit is noisy with a capital \"N\".  Don't plan on placing it near the living spaces in your home if you value your peace and quiet.  Waste frequently lodges between the teeth on the rake so I'm finding myself visually checking anytime I'm near the unit and using my scoop to clear the rake.  About every other day I need to use the scoop to scrape along the bottom of the pan to loosen anything sticking to the bottom so the rake can catch it on the next pass.  Lastly, the included ramp which is supposed to keep your cat from tracking litter is a joke.  It simply isn't big enough and my cats usually jump over it rather than walk down it.  To solve the problem, I continue to leave a small area rug in front of the unit.  That seems to catch about 75% of the tracked litter. the unit isn't cheap.  Taking into account the noise and the other problems, I would still buy the unit if I had to do it over again primarily for the conveninence.",

However, it always worked well but you have to use the correct litter or the Littermaid will not work as advertised.  I never had a problem with the motor failing or other issues I've read in these reviews.  I also read that if the motor jams there is a reset that many user may not know about and this may be a reason for so many returns.  Once again in the year I used it the motor never stopped working.  The box is a bit noisy so I wouldn't suggest setting this in a bedroom.  Also, there is a chance that the rake moving and noise may scare your cat and they will not want to use it. Try setting it up with the power off for a few days and then turn it on after the cat gets use to using the box. The only other issue is that there is a raking motion that pushes all the waste forward but it also pushes good litter with it so the end result is good litter gets dumped into the plastic bin.  I had the option of buying the newer unit but read so many bad reviews that I decided to go for one of the older models.  I also build a table with a hole in it.  Then I cut out the bottom of the plastic container that catches the waste.  Now the unit dumps the waste into a 13 gallon trash bag and I can go quite a while without emptying it.  With the stock container you can go about 3 days with one cat.  If I wasn't setting up the table and larger bag I would look more closely at the Smart Scoop.  It seems to waste less litter.",

If you look at littermaid disposal system at amazon[...] you will see what it sort of looks like.

No, it does not smell, I also add a little baking soda to the trash bag but you do have to clean the littermaid occasionally just like any other litterbox, just not as much. I use Worlds Best Litter (corn litter) makes littermaid work easier and cuts down on the dust from litter. It is a shame that the elite's have sullied the littermaid product name.

Is more expensive but I don't have to constantly throw all of it out so I think I break even. It clumps perfectly and I get very few leavings.2) Empty the recepticals when they are half full. This will help avoid the vile spatter and spilling. Alternatively, seal the top down before taking out the bottom section and then pull the whole thing out, empty it and then put the old set back (I definitely reuse them).3) Don't bother with the tent. It's huge, the opening isn't wide enough to fully open the litter cover when you go to empty it and if your cat is as vigorous as mine at covering the litter, it will get in between the box and tent and is hard to clean.

They told me that it was under their one year warranty. They asked me to cut the white power cord on the rake and return it to them which I did. Within a week they sent me out a brand new litterbox. I am very pleased. Best Customer Service Ever! A+++++I should tell you that I've had this litter box before..About 6 years ago I had 3 cats and bought one of these litter boxes to save my sanity and my back. At the time that I purchased it, it SUGGESTED (NOT REQUESTED)that you use premium cat litter. At that time I saw it as a marketing ploy to get me to buy premium cat litter so I disregarded their suggestion..Bad mistake... It was clogging at least once a week but at the time I still considered this to be nothing considering the fact that I wasnt having to scoop anymore. I had that unit for about 2 and 1/2 years and then it died on me. I still think I got a good deal out of it though.So recently I bought the same litter box again only this time it REQUIRES  you to use the premium cat litter so I bought the \"scoop away\" cat litter at the supermarket. This litter is supposed to be better than the regular litter because it is more absorbent than the regular and it clumps and drys more quickly than the traditional kitty litter. Since the Littermaid Litter box rakes the litter 10 minutes after the cat leaves, you need a litter that can clump and dry quickly. Well, now I get this! Since I bought the litter box (2 weeks ago) I havent had any clogs and am actually using less Kitty litter than before since it clumps so well.The litterbox is turnkey provided you use the premium kitty litter. I am really glad I bought this product. I am happy...Oh, another point, MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THE KITTY LITTER LEVEL BELOW THE SUGGESTED LINE. I have learned that the machine works harder (and breaks more frequently) if you put too much kitty litter in it. I keep the litter a little below the line. This works great.",

I had very little difficulty training the cats to use the new box; I just followed the simple instructions that came with the Littermaid.  The only difficulty I had in getting the cats accustomed to the new box was a teenager who thought it hillarious to yell boo at a cat as it watched the box clean itself.  Needless to say, that cat took a little longer getting used to the LitterMaid and the teenager got the privelege of cleaning the old box.Just as it advertises, 10 minutes after use, the &quot;sifter&quot; runs from one end of the box to the other, lifting the clumps and depositting them in the container at the end.  A few times it had a little difficulty with a very large clump and I heard it reverse and try again several times before successfully completing the trip.  I do have a problem with litter being dumped on the floor, either by an energetic cat or the sifter pushing litter in front of a clump and over the edge.Don't start thinking this will reduce how often you have to deal with a litter box.  You still have to empty the container daily, add/rearrange the litter daily and probably vacuum frequently.  It misses the really small clumps so you'll have to sift once in a while.  However, it only takes a minute to do these tasks and it really keeps down the smell.  In addition, your kitties are using a much cleaner litter box which is better for them!",

        "reviewText": "So here it is, the miracle product??? Yes and no... If you still are willing to maintain a litterbox every couple days yes... If you are not willing to do this, it won't help much to get this type litterbox.  My years of previous experience with cats and boxes have proved quite informative so I'll try to give you the low down and insight that hopefully will help.First, multi cat homes need checked daily, not necessarily changed, just checked.  A large cat can't aim the center of the box, especially portly cats.  They being large cats end up hitting the very end of the litter area with urine then the machine sweeps and it then clings a clump stuck to the plastic.  This only happens once in a while when the cat is facing the machine area and his hind end toward the hopper.  Otherwise, the other reason is a not totally clumped chunk of whatever that gets caught in the teeth then rides back to the original position where it dries and then becomes like concrete.  A good brand of litter helps cure some of those problems.Through trial and error, Everclean litter is a great alternative to the brand that littermaid sells ... sold in pet store and amazon.If you have dogs, place the unit with the hopper away from where your dog can pull it out.  My basset hounds would get the notion to dine and pulled the hopper out and it wasn't a pretty site.  I don't have them anymore that was years ago they did that but the memory is still there!Lastly, this LM900 is a bit quieter than the original, battery life is NOT what they say... two months is not ever going to happen.",

        "reviewText": "This cat box is a lifesaver. My vet recommended trying this when a Persian of mine started having issues of straying from the box. The vet said that some cats are just extra fastidious and no matter how many times a day a person scoops the box as long as there is anything at all in the box they will refuse to use it.I was hesitant at first to get this, fearing that the cat would be frightened of the motor and would become even more traumatized by the litter box. With great trepidation, I set the LitterMaid up, and from that moment on, there has never been a single instance of the cat straying from the box to do his business.Some people say that a motorized cat box is a waste of money, but it is well worth trying if you face a similar dilemma: it can save your sanity and your carpet, and may let some cats stay in loving homes instead of being abandoned or even euthanized.I am absolutely delighted with the LitterMaid, and have had no problems with it, and at this point mine is over two years old. I highly endorse the LitterMaid system.",

Second the trays are expensive and messy to change.  I see where they are now giving you 18 trays for about the same price we were paying for twelve, but at over $1.00 each they are still too much.We recently bought a Scoop Free and are more than happy with it.  It works as advertised and even though the replacement cartridges are expensive, they last a long time and actually cost us less than we were paying for litter alone.  We have now bought a second Scoop Free and find we only use three cartridges a month, and have never had to clean it except for waste that has gotten on the sides that needs to be wiped off, but we would have that problem no matter what type of box we used.If you are thinking about buying an automatic litter box I would suggest you buy the Scoop Free instead of this one.

So, if you are a single cat house, you could reasonably expect 5-7 years of use from one of these.  The first unit's motor died.  The second, the spring in the power rake's cord broke, and couldn't reel in the cord anymore.  The third (my last) up and died, no warning or otherwise.  Just stopped running.My first Littermaid was the original.  It lasted about 4 years.  The next was the original \"Mega Advance\" and was the best when it was working.  That only lasted about 3-4 years.  The last Mega (not advance) lasted about 5-6 years, but was very noisy.This newer unit seems to be basically the same as the last Mega, but the motor is slightly more quiet and pushes the rake through the box at a faster clip.  Both nice improvements.  The included scoop has tines in it to clean out the rake, a great idea that only took 15 years....I've never run my Littermaids on batteries, always using the A/C plug.  If the power's out for a few hours, we can survive, or if needed, scoop.If there was a way to make the system a bit more quiet it would be perfect.Tips:1.  Don't over-fill the box.  Use the bottom (add litter) line as the top fill line.  If you fill to the top line, the system will not work as well.  This seems to be the #1 problem people have, adding too much litter.2.  Use a bit of cooking oil spray (Pam) on the bottom of the pan before you fill with litter.  I rarely clean ours, but when I do, I always spray the bottom of the pan and that really helps keep the box cleaner and helps keep the nasty stuff from getting stuck to the bottom.3.  Use high-quality clumping litter.  We get the big tub of Scoop-Away from Costco.  That lasts more than a month for us.4.  Re-use the waste containers.  They each should last a month or more. Just keep using them until they crack when you are removing to dump the contents.  Then replace.  Saves lots of money there.This would be a 5 star if it was just a bit more quiet overall.",

The last two both stopped working after 2 - 3 years.I can't say anything about the long-term reliability of this one, but it's quieter than the others and the motor sounds stronger.Our kitty has some really big, sticky output that the last one would get stuck in and either just sit in stripping out its gears or reverse and run back and forth. This one doesn't even sound like it's straining and just powers through.All the other design defects are still here - primarily that the litter doesn't all land in the waste tub, and if there's a big clump it can land so that the door stands wide open. But a little more power in the motor makes this a much better product.I did have a problem with the specific package we received - it was missing 11 of the 12 waste tubs, the carbon filters, and the little brush. But after a couple back-and-forth emails with Amazon (who offered to accept a return, but kitty had already inaugurated the new one) and Fox International, who makes the litterbox, two packages showed up with all the missing parts, shipped by Fox.

The problem lies in the structure, which is not strong enough to withstand the weight of an average cat. If your cat likes exploring and climbing on top of things like most cats do, the frame will break quickly.If you're minimally handy, you can very easily make yourself a much better structure using PVC piping and joints (they're inexpensive and can be found in the plumbing section of any hardware store). If your cat is heavy and a climber, I would strongly suggest not even bothering with the supplied frame and building your own right away.Another irritating problem is that replacing the waste receptacles is extremely inconvenient when the littermaid is in the tent.All in all, unless you absolutely have to hide the littermaid, this tent is poorly designed and more trouble than it's worth.",

        "reviewText": "i got my first litter maid so long ago, i saw it advertised in a magazine and ordered it.  Must've been around 1994 or 95.  Not too long after that, i got the tent.  I went through about 3 or 4 Litter Maids in that time, the motors kept working but they got too dirty and it was time for a fresh one, was my thinking.  That one tent outlived all those litter Boxes.  For me, the tent was great, I liked that it was light weight. It wasn't too flimsy, i could always easily unzip it and zip it back.  Sorry to hear the new ones are poorer quality, i hate when that happens. I have ordered one because i am about to start using a Litter Maid again after a couple of years with a Litter Robot, and when i took the tent apart last time, when i got rid of the last Litter Maid, one piece of the frame wouldn't go back on, i don't know why. But i have to say that overall, that one tent i had certainly held up well. My cat is not rough on things so that may be part of my success with this item on my first experience.  At that time, i had recently moved into an apartment that didn't allow pets, but we already had the cat before we moved in so since she is small, quiet and an indoor cat, i thought i would try and see if i could keep her under cover. The tent was perfect. The manager rarely came into my apartment, only for rare repair incidents, and when he would come, i would drap a table cloth over the tent. At worst, if he came in unexpectedly because of an emergency, i don't remember that happening but if it had, the tent itself would not suggest that there was a cat toilet there.  the tent always did a great job of keeping the odor contained. The tent was crucial to my situation and i have good memories of it.  If i'd known they were going to start making a poorer quality tent, i would've saved the other one. It wasn't worn out. Just one piece of the frame came loose and i tried to get it to go back but it wouldn't. I abandoned it too easily probably because i was switching over to the Litter Robot at that time. At first i gave the tent 4 stars just now, but i have to change it to 5 because my tent lasted about 12 years and was still in good shape when i stopped using it, and it really helped me out by minimizing the mess and odor of a cat box, and camouflaged my catbox so that my cover was never blown. I have ordered the current model of the tent and am definitely concerned after reading the bad reviews. It sounds like maybe there is not much quality control and maybe some units are better cut than others. one can only speculate.  i have my fingers crossed.  i will update my review if the assessment changes.10/3/10 UpdateA year ago when i wrote the above, i ordered a new one of these, despite bad reviews.  I wanted the litter Maid to be in a tent, so i ordered it.  It was unusable.  The cover was much too tight for the frame, and it's a really cheap zipper, the little zipper teeth don't mesh together around the whole length of the zipper.I assembled it when i got it and since then, a year ago, it's sat unused in the spare bedroom. It was really diffcult getting it set up because the cover is too tight, but what made it unusable for me is that in order to clean the litter box i need to unzip it partially so i can pull back the tent flaps and get to the litter box.  The zipper is so flimsy and the cover so tight that extreme pressure has to be applied to open or close the zipper, unlike my old original litter maid tent which was tight enough but not a big production to unzip and re-zip. i never even thought about it.  The zipper on the new model i have is so flimsy that it would never hold up under the kind of puilling necessary to open and close it.I just now disassembled it because i'm going to be moving back to my house and i am packing stuff up. It was really hard to unzip and the teeth of the zipper were unmeshed in places.  Very poor.I left the 3 star rating instead of 1 star because the original version of these was so good, lasting a cat's lifetime without problems, i want to give some notice to the fact that it's a good idea with a good design and low cost compared to the fancy litter box disguises, and to the longevity and sturdiness of the original one.  But i would not recommend buying this one, although Amazon will take it back if it's defective so if anyone wants to try it out, your mileage may vary.",

The new ones do not fit the frame in any way, shape or form.

So I tried to massage it on - moved more fabric to the front, got the zipper started - and the zipper separated. Okay, put the zipper back together and try again - the slider became deformed and would no longer fit onto the zipper pin. The metal slider itself started to come apart.

I recently tried a petmate that has a reusable plastic receptacle to which you place little baggies made for it, and its very much similar sized to these receptacles. Returned that terrible box and went back to the littermaid but I have a few extra of the baggies and I am going to try putting them into this receptacle.  They are designed to lift out and cover/tie all in one and that's the only thing I liked about the petmate btw.",

First I tape two of these receptacles together using a clear packing tape.Scotch 3-Inch Core Mailing & Storage Tape, 48 x 50 Millimeter (4 Pack)(Scotch tape comes off too easily) I hold them tightly together and use several pieces of tape in various places around the top.  It then looks like one more substantial receptacle.  I use an old plastic grocery bag like some other people have mentioned so I can reuse it several times and it's less mess.  I then tape the little bubble things that poke through the top of the flap on the litter box and  to the flap.  (On the outside) This holds them in place when the flap goes up during operation.  It eliminates the problem of the receptacle lid not going up with the flap and litter accumulating in front of the box.2/28/09 - I've found a better and neater solution.

She told me this would work within a day...and I must admit, she was right.  I have 3 dogs, 1 of which is always having normal stools, the second has intermittent diarrhea, and the third always has an issue with soft/loose stools.  I initially tried it on my 2 and it cleared up the diarrhea with the one immediately.  The other one who always had an issue with intermittent loose/watery stools, I had her on another regimen which over time gave her stools form, but it was rather costly and she didn't always like eating it (herbal regimen).  This, however, is very easy for me to give to her as she only requires one capsule of which I open into her bowl and mix with canned dog food then hand feed to make sure she eats it, and she eats it as if it were a treat.  I can then feed her the normal dry kibble in her bowl afterwards.  I am continuing this on a daily regiment with my one dog.  I recommend it.  The price is very reasonable and it is easily dispensed.  I am not certain, but I guess you could also just feed the entire capsule to your dog, but I prefer opening it so I know it will work quickly.Update:  August 2013.  I am now feeding 1 capsule daily to both of my dogs who had  loose stool issues.  Once their stools were firm (within a couple of days of opening capsule and adding to wet food), I am now dispensing the entire capsule and everything is fine.  I have one very finicky senior gal so she will only take her meds with peanut butter (she can't spit it out as I scoop it on the roof of her mouth).  Pill pockets work just as well with my other pooch, but since I have gone the route of peanut butter with one, they all get the peanut butter with pills...and it's much cheaper!  I still buy the 3-packs of these capsules from Amazon.com when my supply is getting low, but only using 1 capsule daily per dog, it takes a few months to empty 3 bottles.  I still highly recommend this product and am very pleased with it.  I have even told my veterinarian about it and she is impressed as well.",

        "reviewText": "I'm a big believer in probiotics.  These products are meant to replenish your intestinal bacteria after a stint with antibiotics, or just to help keep it in tip-top shape.  The idea has been around for centuries, but it's only been the last few decades that science understands why those who eat natural products like yogurt seem to be a bit healthier than others.Did you know that most of the immune system is in the gut?  Makes sense when you think about it.  When we eat, there are billions of bacteria, fungus, and viruses on our food.  (Viruses aren't a big problem, since they don't use food as a substrate; they look for living tissue to thrive in.) The stomach with its high acidity helps kill most bacteria and fungus, but some survive and get to the small and large intestine, where they can cause disease that is commonly called food poisoning.  Part of the problem is when there is missing 'good' bacteria that has been killed off or dies for some reason.  This niche may be filled by the bad bugs, leading to an unbalanced fauna in the gut.Pets have the same problem as we do.  And you know what a dog will eat; just about anything!  I find that regular use of a probiotic will help keep diarrhea under control, and makes the pet feel better.  Cats, too, can have digestive problems, and this type of product will probably help.The Gentle Digest seems to work well, and it reasonably easy to administer.  Recommended.",

After about 3 days of giving 2 capsules a day (like some other reviewers I just cracked them open over her food) her stools were back to their nice, firm selves lol and after only about a week her oral papillomas fell off! I have since been able to stop giving this, but plan on always keeping a bottle on hand, especially whenever either of my dogs is prescribed an antibiotic (which I think caused all of these issues in the first place--antibiotics at 6mos old wiped out the natural flora in her gut and affected her immune system).

However, I soon found that it created much more work and hassel than a traditional litter box with plastic liners.One problem I faced was that if the storage bin became full, the clumps would pile up and the lid would not close. Sometimes, the clumps would even spill out of the side of the bin, creating a stinky mess. This problem was exacerbated by the fact that my cats had a tendency to use only one side of the litter box, so the bin would be full on that side in a short amount of time, causing extreme odor and spills. And, with 2 cats, it does not take long to fill that little storage bin, so if you have multiple cats, plan to empty it every couple of days.In addition, I found that the bottom of the box and the rake needed to be cleaned frequently so that they did not accumulate a build-up of crusty litter. If a build-up occurs on the bottom of the box, it will eventually become thick and hard enough that the rake will not be able to pass smoothly through the litter. After chiseling the dried litter off of the bottom of the box a few times (gross!) and dealing with the hassel of having to shake the contents of the storage bin in order to level it out, I finally decided that all of this hassel was not worth it and literally THREW THIS PRODUCT AWAY!

(i explained all the other troubleshooting things i'd done, which are described clearly in the manual.)well, here we are 25 days after ordering, so probably three weeks into daily use. i still have to turn it on and off manually. now, that wouldn't be a HUGE deal, since i'm in there anyway feeding the kittehs. however, because i can't sense when it's been 10 minutes since either cat went in, i have to hope that the clumps are fully formed. i think it has happened that way for me twice. the rest of the times, the mushy clod of unclumped kitty-pee mixed with the clay litter sticks to the rake as it goes through its little journey. also doesn't sound like HUGE deal, does it? well...turns out that the rake doesn't hit the aforementioned sensors until it goes alllll the way to the receptacle end and then allll the way to the resting end. and it can't push through the litter if a big ol' piece of you-know-what is blocking the openings between the rake's teeth. so every time it runs now, i have to sit beside it and use the little toothed plastic scoop to try to get all the gunk out from between the teeth. usually it still hasn't pushed the litter into an even surface by then, so the litter forms little dunes at either end, and it can't get up into the resting position. and i don't want to leave it partially out of the resting position, because that's down the side of the box into the...work area, and a kitteh will ...work on it. so i spend at least as much time as i'd spend scooping a regular box that size to get it cleared out all the way, getting the glued-to-the-bottom gunk out, and cleaning the rake until i can get it far enough up out of the box that nothing will get on it.and the return policy is that you have to return the item in its original condition and packaging. well, i got yer packaging right here, but i am prettty sure that this does not qualify as original condition. oh, did i mention that the gunk gets all up on the track and the sides of the rake? so those have to be cleaned off with a paper towel or something every few days.the good news is that the cats took to it right away--one of them with no urging at all (in fact, while i was still setting it up), and the other when the old box got dirty enough. the bad news is that i'm losing my patience with this contraption and putting it out with the trash any minute. the big boxes--which are easy to scoop, even if that's no fun--are much easier for me. and for now they're in closets or otherwise out of the way, rather than having to be plugged in in the main room.when our third bathroom is finished, i'm aiming for a cat genie, the box with the washable granules that flushes fluid waste away and scoops the poop into a receptacle. it's three times the price of the littermaid, but i'm betting it won't be worse than this.(i can't remember ever writing a negative review before for a product, and certainly not one this negative. think how ..fill in your favorite adjective here.. i must have been to get back on amazon to look for this product again just to write this review. sad.)",

The system uses so little of it compared to traditional boxes that it's a wise investment towards a smooth-running system.All-in-all, it's my opinion that the legitimate drawbacks (litter mess, noise, container cost, sticky clumps, etc.) are a small price to pay for a house that isn't stinky!",

        "reviewText": "I've owned a LitterMaid for the last 6 or 7 years.  These units are generally reliable.  The biggest benefit is the odor control.  The dirty stuff is raked into a plastic catch-bin that has a lid.  The smell is kept to a minimum, until the catch-bin is too full and the lid doesn't close fully.My first LitterMaid's retractable power cord (on the rake) stopped recoiling into the unit, so it eventually got snagged on the rake, and it broke.  That was after more than 3 years of use.  Not bad for a product that runs at least 10-15 times a day (I've got 2 cats).  My second LitterMaid has been going strong since I replaced the last one well over 2 years ago.The most important thing I can suggest is using *premium* clumping litter.  I've been very happy with the ScoopAway brand.  Cheap litter breaks apart and makes a mess.  The next thing is to keep the litter level below the \"max fill\" line.  Too much litter causes the rake to bog down.  Also, cooking oil spray (pam) works very well to keep the clumps from sticking to the bottom.I use the \"disposable\" catch pans over and over until they crack.  I can normally get 2 or 3 months before I consider changing it out.  I can't imagine tossing it out after one filling.  That's a big expense, and a waste of money and a perfectly operable item.  I don't use a liner/bag in the catch.  Just dump the dirty stuff into a bag and out to the trash.  I have two cats and they can fill the catch-bin in 2 to 3 days.  Normally, I just dump the bin, use a scoop to quickly get the smaller bits missed by the rake, and that's it.  I have gone well over 6 months before doing any major cleaning of the box.If you have more than one cat, I would get the \"Mega\" model, since it is bigger.  The new Advanced model isn't getting good reviews here at Amazon, so I would keep away from that unit.The LitterMaids are a bit noisy.  That maybe the biggest drawback.  Also, it is not a perfect cleaner, and will leave little bits that need to be scooped by hand every few days.  There are times when litter will build up in the back of the pan, and the rake will cycle over and over until you level things off (this can mostly be avoided by not filling to the top fill line).  It takes a few weeks to work out all the kinks, but once you do, you will love it.I will always own a LitterMaid because it keeps the house smelling like we don't have cats.",

My dog is a toy lover, but when he realized Mr. Bill also talked when he was bitten, he fell in love. Mr. Bill has been his favorite toy ever since, in spite of the fact that he stopped saying \"oh nooo\" after about 2 days. It felt like the sound box came apart but there's no way to fix it without cutting the doll open. Regardless of the lack of sound, Roscoe carried Bill everywhere and put him through many doggy ER operations. Alas, doggy-medicine failed to save Bill's internal organs. He lasted about 6 months but was definitely worth every penny. Even without any stuffing, I kept the doll because Roscoe kept crying at the trash can when I tried to throw him away. Your dog will love one.Update:  Mr. Bill #2 had a shorter lifespan than Bill #1, but it may have been due to holiday stress. He now joins Bill #1's lifeless body on the shelf. Roscoe has mel been experimenting on Mr. Bill #3 for about 6 weeks, destroying moderately. Basically, I've come to find that each Bill doll's lifespan is going to be dependent on the dog, so if you're really interested in a long lasting toy, this may not be the one for you.To help put the toy's size into perspective (and also to show just how attached my dog has become to Mr. Bill), I have uploaded a picture of Bill and doggy cuddling; it can be found in the Customer Images section on the right side of the product page alongside several other photos from very happy Bill owners.",

For MYYYY dog (and I know this doesn't work with all dogs), if she sees me cuddle and pet her toy for a while first before letting her play with it, she tends to not destroy it (or, at least, not as quickly).  I'm not sure if it's because it gets my scent on it or if she decides that my actions mean it's to be 'babied.\"  I guess I'm playing into her maternal instinct.  This has absolutely been her FAVORITE toy for the LONGEST of all, so I definitely recommend it if stuffies are at all an option for your dog.",

        "reviewText": "The actual toy lasted only a few weeks but for what it was you knew it wouldn't last longer than a rope toy with a dog that likes to chew more than some dogs.Cons:-the arm stuffing came out first-the plush material got really gross with drool on the outside more than other dog toy materialPros:-Mr. Bill iconic soundmaker that says \"Oh Noooooo!\" still working great-batting inside can be reused to make a whole new toy.For those inclined to make their money go further and give Mr. Bill's words new life I have instructions on how you can remake this dog toy into a new one:To reuse the soundmaker I left the soundmaker in Mr. Bill's head because the batting (stuffing) there provided pretty good protection. I removed the batting from the rest of the body and placed Mr.s Bill's head with the soundmaker inside into a long men's sock (think sock monkey). I placed more batting around Mr. Bill's head to give soundmaker more cushioning.  Suggestion: it may be a good idea to use packing tape on the outside of the soundmaker itself to keep it intact (just in case you have dog that likes to chew). One sock is not enough cushion surrounding Mr. Bill's head though because holes can be made easily into just one sock layer and the jaw pressure from a dog's mouth could break the plastic on the soundmaker. Because of this, I suggest 2-3 socks (short or long on the inside) with the outermost sock long because then you can tie 2-3 knots at the end.  What you have is a long body that you can draw some eyes on with permanent marker on one end of the body and the knots at the other end will be like a rope toy.Pros from this design:-dog can play with either end of the toy.-person can throw toy (without much drool) with the knotted end easily.-more stuffing= more protection for the soundmaker you wanted to reuse.-it's easier to notice when the toy is being destroyed- then you just rewrap in another sock!Toy Diagram (Size approximate):[--10 inches long---] & 2-3 inches wide/~~~~~~~~~\\|~O~~~~~~~||~O~~~~~~~|--^-^-^--\\|~~~~~~~~~|--~-~-~--/\\~~~~~~~~~/",

Though these toys do have stuffing so you have to watch your dogs, only portions of the toy rip easily for access to the stuffing (like the face). I have taught the puppy that if he tears his toy, \"mommy\" will just sew it up with dental floss and then he has to find a new place to tear. He learned quickly and no longer destroys every toy when it arrives! (If you do this, do yourself a favor and use the regular unflavored dental floss. I made the mistake of using a mint floss the first time I sewed up Lambchop and the puppy licked the poor lamby until it was one big spitball.) It turned out that both the puppy and the Lab are enamored with Lambchop and I was about to order two more but when I read the tag I discoverd these are made in China. I am usually very careful about food and toys that are made in China but had neglected to check this item.

Just be *sure* to buy the size that suits your dog; don't buy one too small that can be swallowed easily!  Dr. Noys' toys are great in that they always include an extra squeaker in the pack, and the toy squeaker is easily replaceable in its hidden velcro pouch. (Squeakers are not indestructible; that's why they include an extra. But the advantage here is that they are very secure, and can't be eaten.) You can even buy separate packages of squeakers if your dog is tough on plush toys. Or you can remove the squeaker if it drives you crazy! ;-)Pay attention to the sizes listed: extra-small is really small, best for only the tiniest toy breeds or for small puppies. Medium will work for most dogs, but if your dog is a shredder, loves to destroy plush toys, only get the large sizes. If you have certain breeds, like Staffordshire terriers and bull dogs, then perhaps another toy would be a wiser choice. You know your dog.So if you're tired of buying so-called \"dog toys\" that are really glorified baby toys and are easily destroyed, try these. Ours have lasted for two years with hard play, only replacing the squeakers.  Even better, they're usually included in the Amazon 4-for-3 promotion, so you can get one free if you buy four!  That way you can test out different designs, or save one for later. Highly recommended!",

A little bit of stuffing came out - not sure what part of the bears body - but other then that she is still playing with the bear. Let's see how long the body will last before she shredds it to pieces. I'm still looking for a toy that she cannot destroy and I haven't found it yet. I think toymakers need to give me the toys to test and then if they survive they can be stamped 'Macie approved'",

        "reviewText": "My husband & I have 3 wonderful pups/dogs that LOVE to play with stuffed animals.  The problem is that they usually destroy them quickly, as they really enjoy playing with their stuffed toys together - with one pulling a leg & another pulling a arm, and they are also known to chew on them until they get to the insides - where they then work on spreading the filling all over our house.Because of this we decided not to get them anymore plush toys.  But then I read the description for Dr. Noys Teddy Bear & decided to give it a try.  My \"babies\" have been playing with it for almost a month now and it's still in pretty good condition - it's nearly indestructable!  (This is a record for us, as most stuffed animals are completely destroyed in an hour or less!)The stitching is done extrememly well - with the only part getting chewed open being the nose.  But one of the best things is that there's only a tiny bit of stuffing in there - so even when they got the nose off, there was just one little blob of filling to pick up - and they can still play with it!Another plus is how easy it is to replace the squeaker.  We haven't had to do it yet, but I checked it out - and it really is amazingly easy!  And it comes with an extra squaker too!Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend Dr. Noys Plush Teddy Bear to all pet owners - it's well made, nearly indestructable and our dogs LOVE it!",

        "reviewText": "I've had the Dr. Noys teddy bear in the medium size for almost 6 months, purchased for my 30 lb sheltie girl.  Our dog is not a \"sit down and try to rip apart\" kind of dog, but she does love to play tug-o-war!  I usually grip the head while she grabs onto either the squeaking body or one of the limbs, and she hops and pulls and shakes and play-growls until she gets too thirsty to continue.  Hubby and I also play keep-away with the bear, tossing it back and forth so she'll run between us for some exercise (she's not much of a retriever).  Sometimes she'll pick up the bear and bring it over to me to let me know it's time to play, but otherwise she really doesn't play with the bear on her own.  Not the fault of the bear, it's just the way my sheltie is, and I hope it gives you a better idea of how this bear might hold up with your dog.This bear came with a free replacement squeaker, which I placed inside the fleece bag that contains the other squeaker, for extra squeaking fun.  Probably because of the extra protection the fleece gives, both squeakers have survived my little girl's needle sharp teeth.  The fleece thing inside the bear also gives it bulk, without that messy stuffing that dogs so love to pull out.  I could hear and feel stitches pop on occasion while playing tug-o-war, but this toy really has held up well compared to other plush dog toys.  For 5 months, this bear looked perfect, other than the slobber on it.  Our bear has about three sizeable holes and is missing a bit of fur on its chest, which all happened in the last month, but we still use it because there's no stuffing in the bear.  I'm currently looking for another Dr. Noys toy as a replacement, when that teddy bear goes to tug-o-war heaven.In addition to being very sturdy, this bear is super cute.  I have a photo of the Dr. Noys teddy bear in the arms of my sheltie who was laying down, and it's a photo I'll cherish forever.**UPDATE**  We've purchased our 2nd Dr. Noys teddy bear in medium size.  I tried buying regular stuffed animals, the kind intended for kids, at second hand stores but they all got pulled apart.  We now have 2 shelties and they've been plucking at this Kong teddy bear's nose for a week (they really like that fleecy material) and this bear is holding up like a champ.",

The body of the toy is only a couple inches long plus an additional couple inches for the unstuffed tail. It's great for small breeds, like shih tzus but I would hesitate to give this little thing to bigger dogs as I would be afraid they could shallow it. Just like with other Kong toys, the back is sealed with Velcro to replace the squeaker if need be and an extra squeaker is included. All in all it's a good toy and my dog does play with it (although it's definitely not on her short list of favorites) but be prepared that this is a tiny tiny toy.Just a note - the pictures show two different toys. I received the one with the dark, flat tail not the one with the fluffy lighter tail. I can't imagine that matters to anyone all that much but I just wanted to let you know which one I received.",

        "reviewText": "These toys are among the best plush dog toys out there, and we've tried several. I don't think any are truly \"indestructible\" since there's always a dog somewhere that will defy that claim, but these are well made and worth buying for the majority of dogs.  Just be *sure* to buy the size that suits your dog; don't buy one too small that can be swallowed easily!  Dr. Noys' toys are great in that they always include an extra squeaker in the pack, and the toy squeaker is easily replaceable in its hidden velcro pouch. (Squeakers are not indestructible; that's why they include an extra. But the advantage here is that they are very secure, and can't be eaten.) You can even buy separate packages of squeakers if your dog is tough on plush toys. Or you can remove the squeaker if it drives you crazy! ;-)  In the larger sizes you can replace the squeaker with a tennis ball for active dogs.Pay attention to the sizes listed: extra-small is really small, best for only the tiniest toy breeds or for small puppies. Medium will work for most dogs, but if your dog is a shredder, loves to destroy plush toys, only get the large sizes. If you have certain breeds, like Staffordshire terriers and bull dogs, then perhaps another toy would be a wiser choice. You know your dog.So if you're tired of buying so-called \"dog toys\" that are really glorified baby toys and easily destroyed, try these. Ours have lasted for two years with hard play, only replacing the squeakers. Even better, they're usually included in the Amazon 4-for-3 promotion, so you can get one free if you buy four (smaller sizes)!  That way you can test out different designs, or save one for later. Highly recommended!",

I put both squeakers in to make it fill out and squeak more easily.... it's tiny!  It is good for a small dog puppy, not a larger breed puppy, unless it wants to play with something the size of a mouse.  My dog gets very excited about toys but this was quickly abandonned after a little over 5 minutes.  She's 13 lbs.

There's not a dog toy made that can withstand the chewing of a particularly determined mutt. So the only really fair tests for a dog toy are whether your dog likes it; whether it's safe; and whether it holds up reasonably well when subjected to day-to-day gnawing? With those tests in mind, the \"Dynamic Duo,\" (a male Westie and female Scotty) give Frosty Dog four stars. They are currently trying to dismember their second. The first one lasted a year, the last six months of which were spent with two legs and no nose. And they would still be playing with it, except that I got tired of looking at the poor bedraggled thing. By the way, I think that the \"large\" FD is probably the right size for all, but the very smallest, dogs. The Dynamic Duo only weigh in at 20 pounds each, but the \"large\" FD suits them fine.",

Held up quite well (looked perfect for the first 5 months), so I decided to get another Dr. Noys toy for my little girl, as she loves stuffed toys.I don't use this medium-size Frosty Dog for tug-o-war, as it's a bit too small, she ends up accidentally biting my fingers when she tries to get a better grip on the toy (didn't have that problem with the medium size teddy bear).So instead, my husband and I play keep-away with the Frosty Dog, tossing it back and forth so she'll run between us for some exercise (she's not much of a retriever).  When we throw it short so she has a chance to get the toy, she pounces on it and prances around with it in her mouth like it's the best thing ever.  She'll also run to her toy box and select this toy when my husband is laying on the floor doing back exercises, and she'll plop the Frosty Dog on his chest as a not-so-subtle way of saying \"Since you're down here at my level, play with me!\".  Sometimes when our sheltie is super happy, she'll pick the Frosty Dog up and hold it in her mouth for a minute, squeaking the toy every couple seconds, just for the joy of it.  The squeaker has held up great over 2 months of her joyful squeaking.  She simply loves this toy.My dog is not a determined toy destroyer, thankfully.  But, based on my experience with my other Dr. Noys teddy bear toy, their toys are built to be far superior to other plush toys.**UPDATE**  September 13th, 2008:  Last week, I had to take this toy away because Zoey had managed to pluck open the side of the Frosty Dog's face, exposing the irresistible stuffing inside.  Curses!  If I had sewing skills, I'd take upholstery thread (tough stuff!) and sew it back up.  But, I don't have sewing skills.  Double curses!

Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution, but that is extremely expensive, especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks, just fleas.

Within a week of the first dose of Advantage my whole home settled right down and the cats and I were no longer getting any bites. My cats are 16, 18, and 24 pounds. (Yes, the vet and I have gone rounds and rounds with the big boy.) The 9 pounds and up vial is fine for them. Just one vial, and an upset cat for a few moments for putting stuff on their shoulders, and the fleas are gone.At first I thought there were no more fleas in the neighborhood, but the neighbors pets were still covered in fleas. Apparently when you have a pet, the fleas prefer the animal and will go to it (treated or not) for a feast. When the flea medicine works, all the fleas in the home are wiped out too. Vet said I didn't need to waste my money on flea bombs for the house since we have cats. Living in a humid environment (Oregon where we don't tan, we rust) Advantage actually seems to work better and fleas are less likely to develop a tollerance.I have a reminder that tells me to get more medicine every month, and won't be without this. Best product for my area.I had heard that some people were buying this in pet stores and inside the packaging and blister seal was another product (Advantix for large dog), but buying through Amazon so far I have never had that happen. I still check each tube before administering the medicine though. I don't know if I have just been lucky, because our Dentist's receptionist said she just went through this when she bought the product at the pet store. I still strongly recommend this product though. Just check everything to be sure.",

My friend's Yorkie had a seizure within 40 minutes of this product being put on him.  All of these topicals are poison.  Search online for natural flea and pest control; you'll find lots of options.  One thing we use is neem soap on our dogs; it not only kills pests but it also repels them.  You can also make a natural spray using 1 cup distilled water, several drops of an essential oil like cedar wood, citronella, lavendar, peppermint.  You need to also add a tsp of castile soap so the essential oils will mix with the water.  Spray on your hands and rub all over your dog's coat before it goes outdoors in areas where there could be pests.  Re-apply every 2 hrs.  This is safe for pets and works; nothing harmful.  Don't get the spray mixture in their eyes, nose and mouth.  Vets say these are safe but that's not true.  The companies also only test these products for 30-90 days because they know that longer useage will show damage to the animal's liver.  Anything put on the skin is absorbed into the blood stream and then passes through the liver.  NO to this junk; it's as bad as spraying your pet with Raid.",

We actually considered dosing his feet to give him some relief (!not serious, just joking!), he is very sensitive to flea bites!We have 1 dog, 7 full time house cats (currently), 2 outdoor cats, and a couple of semi-feral cats that we treat and feed when they are around. Since the dog version of the medication is the same active ingredient as the cat, we buy the large dog and meter it out based on their weight. One of our cats is sensitive to the \"recommended\" dose strength. We have found that if we dose based on how many mL should be administered per pound, we save even more...and of most imporatance, we are not giving a larger dose of chemicals than is needed to achieve the same results!Relief for the pets was immediate. The same day that we applied the chemical, they stopped scratching as bad. Since the house is all hardwood, no rugs, no carpet, very little cloth of any kind anywhere due to allergies...with continued cleaning of the house on a daily basis, the population of fleas soon dwindled to almost nothing. Four stars because it is a chemical. I really wish there was an organic alternative that is effective! We use food grade diatomaceous earth in the house, but only as a dusting before we vaccuum.

They all had fleas after I forgot to treat my dog before I went on a lengthy vacation and one of my cats ended up living outside for two weeks (escaped while I was on vacation).  Anyway, I was so worried and upset when I discovered that my pets had fleas.  I gave them all flea baths, picked off live fleas, gave them other flea treatments that didn't seem to work (the store-bought flea drops, for example), washed linens, and I still could not get rid of them or even see a dent in the population.  That's when I decided to start hunting online for a solution since taking them all to the vet would be very expensive.I bought the large dog Advantage (>55 lbs) with the intent to divide it amongst my pets.  I used all but 0.5 ml of one vial for the first treatment.  I have not treated them a second time yet, but they are due very soon.  After treatment, the place on their back was not greasy.  In fact, by the second day, I couldn't even tell they had something put on their backs, and it didn't smell bad.  It did not smell AT ALL.  On day one, I found quite a few fleas laying around on the bed blanket. They had evidently jumped off the pets.  They seemed very confused and slow, but were still alive.  I made sure I killed them in case they were only temporarily impaired.  By the next day, I could find no evidence of fleas on my pets....not even any flea debris (I guess the pets had groomed themselves to remove it). All the pets were extremely thankful for treatment and extra loving after they no longer had fleas pestering them.I've continued to snuggle with my pets, checking them daily for fleas or signs of them, and monitor the bedding for any evidence of fleas.  NOTHING to be seen or found!  I am so happy with the Advantage flea treatment!  I will treat them all again in a few days in order to make sure any new eggs hatching don't re-infest the pets.I put 1 ml each on a 13 lb rat terrier, 20 lb cat, and 16 lb cat.  On my smaller 6 lb cat, I administered 0.5 ml.  I certainly wanted to make sure I gave them enough since I think I had a serious flea problem and knew some of the medicine would be rubbed off onto their surroundings.  They suffered no ill effects, only benefits, from the Advantage.  I benefited greatly by only spending $31.50 on Advantage that would treat all of my pets (4) for 4 months (plus 2 large pets for another month OR the dog for two more months, who is really the one who needs protection since he goes potty outside).  I really recommend this product.  My pets and I thank you!In addition, I ordered this product late on a Monday night and had it in my position by Thursday evening.  Not bad for using the free shipping option.",

        "reviewText": "As a former Veterinary Technician I have considerable experience and knowledge about fleas and their life cycle. However, you don't have to be a technician to do a google or wikipedia search to learn a little bit before writing an ignorant review. The vast majority of the bad reviews I have read here, are obviously (to me) from people who really do not understand where fleas come from and what you have to do to eliminate them.Here's the thing: 90% of the flea population that feeds off of your pet are NOT ON THE ANIMAL RIGHT NOW. That's right, the vast majority of the pests are actually on your floors, carpets, furniture, pet beds and so forth - waiting to hop on Spike and Fluffy when they are hungry. Fleas feed, then jump off the animal, while some more of their family jump on and start feeding in their place. To truly manage the flea problem requires TREATING THE ANIMAL AND THE PREMISES. If you do not treat the premises (including the yard) you will never get ahead of the problem. Sevin dust in the yard or some pyrethrin-based spray have been effective for me for many many years.Also, the lack of effectiveness that people think they are seeing is not because the product is not as good, it is because the fleas have become tougher over the years. You just have to attack the problem on all fronts and be as persistent as the pests themselves. Treat the animals and the premises and don't let up.Now, I am going to save some people a lot of money. The drug in Advantage for Dogs and Advantage for Cats is exactly the same drug (Imidacloprid) at the same concentration.If you buy this \"Large Dog\" package, you get four 4ml tubes. If you then empty those into a vial or vials, you can use a syringe (without needle) to apply the right dosage to your dogs AND cats. In fact, if your cats are under 10 pounds, you can get 10 cat doses out of each of these vials. That's a real bargain!Advantage II is the same, but adds Pyriproxyfen for the full life cycle coverage.Use the following chart and you will be fine.Cats up to 9 pounds - 0.4mlCats 10+ pounds - 0.8mlDogs 11-20 pounds - 1.0mlDogs 21-55 pounds - 2.5mlDogs 55+ pounds - 4.0ml",

It got the odor out instantly and the carpets ended up stain free. I used aBISSELL Lift-Off Deep Cleaner, 94Y2as a portable spot cleaner, and was able to let the pre-treat do most of the work by merely giving a slight spray with the machine and a light brushing as it vacuumed up the spot. There's no question that the two worked well in combination, and with the rotating brushes of the full machine you could expect it to do an outstanding job.I did have some older hidden stains that it did not remove, but those are ones that had already been treated with other Bissell pet and non-pet products in the past, as well as with non-Bissell products. So if you have some stains so tough that absolutely nothing seems to get them out, this one might not work miracles. And Bissell's non-pet oriented products are pretty good to begin with, so using them alone might be all you need.

Terrific little gadget for making playtime fun for you and your dog.  Be sure to get the appropriate size for your dog's mouth.  This comes in several sizes.  Make sure the ball is not small enough for the dog to accidentally get it lodged in the throat, or so large that the dog strains the jaws trying to hold on to it.",

I dismissed it as simply a gimmick for people who didn't want to bend over to pick up a ball, and/or had no idea how to throw a ball. Nearly a decade later, I finally decided to give one a try.I have no problem throwing a ball a fair distance with my arm, but the Chuckit allows me to throw it even further, with significantly less effort.Though regular tennis balls work fine, I'd recommend using the Fetch balls that Chuckit sells. Compared to tennis balls, they're easier to clean, I don't have to worry about my dog chewing them (since there is no fuzz for her to rip off), and they bounce a lot better (even on grass).I also have the Erratic ball, but don't recommend it as much. It certainly lives up to its name when it bounces around, but its awkward shape makes it more difficult to fit snugly into the Chuckit, which makes it more difficult to throw, meaning it doesn't travel nearly as far.",

With minimal effort it easily doubles the distance I can throw (with launcher 225-250') giving our pup double the exercise per throw.  It also increases the speed of the ball and I've noticed that our dog is more excited to play fetch when he has to chase a faster moving object and exerts more energy when chasing.  It could be that we play enough fetch (at least three 10-15 min sessions a day) that I'm going to feel a bit sore, or it could be that the launcher makes me use muscles that I don't normally use, but either way it's still a minor arm workout for me.  I'm 6' and have trained my dog to bring the ball to me and put it in my hand.  If the ball is on the ground I still have to bend over some to click it into the launcher, so I just have him hand me the ball and I stick it in the launcher.

You see, my husband is an avid hunter and although we did not buy the dog only for hunting - we wanted a family dog that can go like we do - we had hoped that one way we could get him exercised would be through retrieving. We attempted to begin the awakening of genetics early (the day we brought him home). However, we have children, and although we warned them many times and watched the dog training videos together, as a family, on a loop for days - they thought playing chase and tag with him was a load of fun (which, lets be honest, it is)! Needless to say, he would chase the ball, BUT good luck getting him to bring it back! After the children realized what they had actually done - they vowed no more chase with balls...and we have attempted to begin the training over again. A couple of months ago I started working with him with a Kong ball - the red one. He would retrieve for a little bit - 5 or so throws and then start messing around. I read and watched more videos and worked/played more with him...but he would lose interest, and I had a SLIMEY hand - gross. So, when I saw the Chuck-it and it was on sale - I bought it. I thought at least my hand would not be so icky. It was L-o-V-e at first throw for this guy! He is absolutely obsessed! We bought the rubber balls as he is an avid chewer and would destroy a tennis ball in 2 seconds flat - and the rest is history.

Often it just sticks in the holder and he barks and barks when I futilely try to fling the ball again and again.  I've even broken the grabber end trying to 'stretch it out' so the ball will release.Hard to describe, but this version of the chuckit is just great.  The whole white stick is more flexible and springy and the ball grabber end is also more flexible so the ball doesn't get stuck.GREAT improvement and definitely better than the original design.  It's worth the money and the only style I'll buy in the future.  Each chuckit lasts over a year for me...",

It's easy to place the throw exactly where one wants.The Pro version is about an inch shorter than the 26M, which may not matter to most folks, but it means an extra inch bending over.  An inch won't matter to most, but if one has a bad back and a dog that insists on fifty or more tosses per session, it adds up.  Nevertheless, the dog gets a better workout and the Pro version is worth the extra few bucks.The handle is much more comfortable too.  Rubberized and form-fitting.  The original Chuck-it was the best man-dog interactive toy ever; this new Pro version is a refinement over the original and well worth it..",
